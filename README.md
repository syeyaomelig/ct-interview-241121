## Home Test ##

Dear candidate,

Thank you for taking the CannonTrading home test.

At CannonTrading we often need to retrieve data from different sources and make that data available in our APIs.

One of those is the ASX listed companies. The list of companies is available online as a CSV (the URL is in the appsettings). An example CSV file is included in the Docs folder. Also that list is updated once a day.

For this test, we have started a new API project with one endpoint. That endpoint gets an ASX listed company by its ASX code.

The goal of this test is to make it work with code that could be released to production (resilient, efficient etc...).

Feel free to add / change anything you'd like as you see fit.

Please submit your changes as a pull request.

All the best, and looking forward to see what you come up with!
